        <h2 id="Fringing">Fringing reefs</h2>
        <img src="Fringing_reefs.jpg" alt="Fringing" height=350 width=260>

        <p>Fringing reefs are the most common type of coral reef. They grow seaward near coastlines of islands and
            continents, usually separated from the shore by no more than a shallow lagoon. These reefs consist of two
            parts: the reef flat (closest to shore) and the reef slope (facing the open ocean). Most marine life on
            fringing reefs live along the slope. The largest fringing reef in the world is the Ningaloo Reef along the
            western coast of Australia. Spanning more than 160 miles, the Ningaloo Reef support an exceptional diversity
            of marine species.Fringing reefs (e.g., Fig. 1) are one of the most common reef types and are characterized
            by shallow reef platforms that attach to the bordering coast, extending anywhere from 10s to 100 s of meters
            in width that
            tend to orient parallel to the coast and expand seaward. Found frequently in the Bahamas and the Red Sea,
            fringing reefs are unique in that their backreef region or reef flat (the area between the shore and the
            reef edge) is consistently shallow, often 2 m deep (Kennedy and Woodroffe, 2002). Corals grow both on the
            reef flat as well as on the reef slope, the offshore edge of the reef that slopes downward toward the
            underlying substrate. The ecological community on the reef slope tends to be more abundant and diverse,
            since the reef slope is subject to more wave action which can help disperse any pollutants and introduce
            nutrients. Offshore sediment transport may occur on reef slopes along ridge, or spur and groove,
            systems, which add topographic relief to the offshore edge of the reef.</p>

        <img src="Atoll_reefs.jpg" alt="Atoll" height=350 width=290>


        <p>Atolls are rings of reefs located in the open ocean. They form when fringing reefs grow around volcanic
            islands that eventually sink into the ocean. Atolls usually takes a horse-shoe shape and a lagoon is always
            found in the middle of one. The northern-most coral atoll in the world is Kure Atoll which lies within
            Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument. Kure is an important nesting area for many seabird species,
            wintering area for a variety of migratory bird species, and an important pupping and resting area for
            Hawaiian Monk seals. Another famous atoll is the Rose Atoll which remains one of the most pristine atolls in
            the world. In 2012, Rose Atoll Marine National Monument was incorporated as part of the National Marine
            Sanctuary of American Samoa during its expansion.Most of the reef itself is a submarine feature, rising from
            the abyssal floors of the ocean to just beneath high-tide level. Around the rim along the top of the reef
            there are usually low, flat islands or more continuous strips of low, flat land. Some of these islands have
            been settled by oceanic peoples like the Maldivians, Polynesians, and Micronesians for many centuries.</p>

        <h2 id="Barrier">Barrier reefs</h2>
        <img src="Barrier_reefs.jpg" alt="Barrier" height=350 width=290>

        <p>Barrier reefs are similar to fringing reefs in that they are found near shore. What makes barrier reefs
            different is the fact that they are separate from land. Instead, they are separated by a deep water lagoon
            that forms between the reef and the shore. Their name comes from the fact that they form a barrier between
            the coast and the open ocean. The most famous barrier reef is the Great Barrier Reef, a chain of smaller
            barrier reefs off the coast of Australia. In North America, there is only one coral barrier reef and it is
            protected by Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary.Barrier reefs typically form in open water rather than
            immediately adjacent to a shoreline, and it is only through evolution of the substrate surrounding the reef
            or a change in sea-level that they become associated with a shoreline. Barrier reefs are rare, but include
            some of the world's most famous reefs: the Australian Great Barrier Reef and Belize's Barrier Reef. The
            Great Barrier Reef in Australia formed on a coastal plain that was flooded during rapid sea-level rise from
            20,000 to 6000 years ago. The flooded hills of the coastal plain provided shallow regions for corals to
            grow, and these locations now make-up the reefs and cays of the Great Barrier Reef. </p>

        <h2 id="coralreefs"> All three types of reefs</h2>
        <p>All three types of reefs offer important ecosystem services that benefit ocean ecosystems and human society.
            This is even more impressive when we consider coral reefs cover less than 1 percent of the earth’s surface
            and less than 2 percent of the ocean floor, yet they support more than 25 percent of all life in the ocean.
            From providing food to shelter to safe places for spawning and nurseries, they are very important to the
            ecosystem. Coral reefs also become much of the sand we love to dig our toes into on tropical beaches. When
            strong waves or ocean animals break off old or dying sections of a reef, their calcium carbonate skeletons
            get pulverized or digested into a fine sand that eventually settle and build up on the world’s beaches. To
